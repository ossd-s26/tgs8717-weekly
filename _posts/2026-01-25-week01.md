# Week 1 - Intro

## What is Open-Source to Me?
When I hear the term "open source," I think of a project or piece of work where people of diverse backgrounds may freely contribute with the goal of making the project better than it was before. Some advantages of open-source is that it is transparent, allowing everyone to access the material. Some advantages of closed-source is that it can be more secure and perform better due to its access being restricted to people with professional knowledge in regards to the project. Some potential problems of open-source may be that due to its open nature, it may be prone to security threats.

I decided to register for a class about open-source software development because it seems like a practical and hands-on way to apply previously learned knowledge about computer science. Its open-ended nature also allows me to tailor my work to projects that suit my interests.

## Open-Source Projects That I Use
Some open-source projects that I use include:
- Python
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub
- Yomitan (pop-up dictionary for language-learning)
- Anki (flashcard program)
